# 🧊 Cube of Array Elements Using Pointer (C Language)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Write a C program to find the **cube of each element of a 1D array using pointers**.

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

* Take array size and elements from the user
* Pass the base address of the array to a function
* Use a **pointer** to access and modify array elements
* Calculate cube of each element using pointer dereferencing
* Update the original array directly

## 🔄 Working Explanation

* The pointer points to the first element of the array
* Using a loop, the pointer accesses each element
* Each element is cubed using:
  `value × value × value`
* Pointer is incremented to move to the next element
* Modified values are stored back in the same array

## 🛠 Concepts Used

* 1D Array
* Pointer arithmetic
* Pointer dereferencing
* User-defined functions
* Looping (`for` loop)

## 🎯 Conclusion

This program demonstrates how **pointers can be used to manipulate array elements directly** in C.
It is an efficient approach and commonly asked in **college practical examinations** ✅
