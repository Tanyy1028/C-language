# 🔁 Reverse 1D Array and Find Sum (C Language)

## 📌 Problem Statement

Write a C program that defines a **function** to:

* Print the elements of a **1D array in reverse order**
* Find and print the **sum of all array elements**

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

* Take array size and elements from the user
* Pass the array and its size to a user-defined function
* Traverse the array **from last index to first**
* Print elements in reverse order
* Add each element to calculate the total sum
