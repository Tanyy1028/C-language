# 🧮 Simple Calculator in C Language

## 📌 Problem Statement

Implement a C program to simulate a **simple calculator** that performs the following operations based on user input:

* Addition (`+`)
* Subtraction (`-`)
* Multiplication (`*`)
* Division (`/`)

---

## 🧠 Logic Used

* Take two numbers from the user
* Take an operator as input
* Use `switch-case` to perform the selected operation
* Handle **division by zero** properly
* Display the result up to **2 decimal places**

## 📥 Sample Input

```
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Enter operator (+, -, *, /): *
```

---

## 📤 Sample Output

```
Result = 50.00
```

---

## 🛠 Concepts Used

* `switch-case` statement
* Conditional statements (`if-else`)
* User input using `scanf()`
* Arithmetic operators
* Float data type

---

## ⚠️ Special Case Handling

* Division by zero is checked and handled safely
* Invalid operator input shows an error message

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

This program demonstrates how to build a **menu-driven calculator** using basic C programming concepts.
It is a **beginner-friendly**, **exam-oriented**, and **practical-ready** program ✅
